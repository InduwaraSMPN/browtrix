# TASK
Build a Streamable HTTP MCP server named browtrix in FastMCP(Python) with three tools:

1. Take a HTML snapshot of a web page (browtrix_html_snapshot).
2. Show a confirmation alert on a user’s web page (browtrix_confirmation_alert).
3. Show a question popup on a web page and take the user’s answer (browtrix_question_popup).

The MCP server’s tool should be usable from any MCP Client.
The interacting web page should be implemented in nextjs(React) and should connect to the MCP server using WebSocket.
