Build a MCP server in Python with three tools:
1. Take a HTML snapshot of a web page.
2. Show a confirmation alert on a user’s web page.
3. Show a question popup on a web page and take the user’s answer.

The MCP server’s tools (front-channel) should be usable from Claude Desktop.

The interacting web page should be implemented in React and should connect to the MCP server (back-channel) using WebSocket.
